# create-your-first-pull-request-uv1l-centeno
Week 01 Exercise GIT - CMSC 100 

Upon doing this activity, I had to setup my git bash. I had a LOT of errors. I managed to add and commit but hwne it comes to pushing there were a lot of errors.I suppose, changing the directory into the specific repositiry resolved the problem.

Regarding this activity, I did the following:

1. cloned the new repository I made
2. initialized it and made a new text file using "touch"
3. I added the new txt file (expectations)
4. I pushed it
-- there were erros in this, the rejection says that there were unrelated directories and sometimes permission denials
5. I cloned the repository of my groupmate
6. made a branch named centeno
7. edited the expectations.txt using nano
8. I added and pushed
9. We made a pull request then merged
