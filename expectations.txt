I am wholly intimidated and worried about this course as I have no prior knowledge of the topics shown in the course guide. Even in the starting topics Git and Github I am having troubles doing the add->commit->push. I can do it, however, I am very slow in doing so. I am expecting to suffer a lot in this course and fight tooth and nail to survive.

- I too have almost no prior knowledge in the topics related to this course beyond very basic HTML and CSS. It is indeed intimidating but I believe with all the resources we have on the internet, we can gain decent skills eventually through practice. In the end, it will all come donw to how much time we have to practice these skills. I hope we both would be able to make time for it!

To be honest, I am not really an achiever my only goal is to pass the course and retain some knowledge. I would be very satisfied if I were to get a 2.75, though if I get a bit higher than that, it is also would be nice. 

Comments from Vivekjeet:
- I think that is ok, as long as you learn the essentials from the course, you will be competent in this field wherever you go.

In my current section, I really have no one I am close with. I hope I get to be amicable and be friends with someone, even just one. I have a good feeling with my seatmate. I hope we can be friends. Just one is enough. 

Comments from Vivekjeet:
- Yes of course we can be friends! I don't have a lot of close friends either due to being a transferee, but even if I did, I'd still be open to being friends with you.

I have lab classes starting from 10 AM - 7 PM on Mondays. I guess I just want to suffer in one big swoop that's why I chose to concentrate my lab classes on one day and move the remaining one to the next day. I am worried since I generally do not perform well in lab classes you see. Taking the classes while not bothering to see my grades after doing the activities in order to avoid additional stress is how I cope. I just... want things to be over and just roll with the punches until the semester ends. I guess I just expect to be worn out by all my courses in general not just this subject

Comments from Vivekjeet:
- I am kind of in a similar struggle, but not as difficult as this. I have two lab classes on mondays instead of three, I do not think I can survive without eating lunch. However, as a consequence, I have one lab class everyday after Monday. My schedule could have been better but due to the lack of slots in this university, we have to fight for and accept anything we can get. I am just thankful that I even got these slots. I hope in the midst of the chaos in college, you won't forget to take care of yourself to avoid a lot of unecessary problems down the line. Let's make it worth it and get through this sem successfully!
