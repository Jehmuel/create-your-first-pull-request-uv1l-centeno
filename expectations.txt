I am wholly intimidated and worried about this course as I have no prior knowledge of the topics shown in the course guide. Even in the starting topics Git and Github I am having troubles doing the add->commit->push. I can do it, however, I am very slow in doing so. I am expecting to suffer a lot in this course and fight tooth and nail to survive.

To be honest, I am not really an achiever my only goal is to pass the course and retain some knowledge. I would be very satisfied if I were to get a 2.75, though if I get a bit higher than that, it is also would be nice. 

In my current section, I really have no one I am close with. I hope I get to be amicable and be friends with someone, even just one. I have a good feeling with my seatmate. I hope we can be friends. Just one is enough. 

I have lab classes starting from 10 AM - 7 PM on Mondays. I guess I just want to suffer in one big swoop that's why I chose to concentrate my lab classes on one day and move the remaining one to the next day. I am worried since I generally do not perform well in lab classes you see. Taking the classes while not bothering to see my grades after doing the activities in order to avoid additional stress is how I cope. I just... want things to be over and just roll with the punches until the semester ends. I guess I just expect to be worn out by all my courses in general not just this subject
